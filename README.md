# storyscaping
This is the repository of the 3rd semester Storyscaping exam project, BAAA 2020, Group 6.

This repository includes a plugin called 'catalogueplugin'.
It's a simple pop-up plugin that lets users download ReGrow's catalogue and contact them directly.
It uses the shortcode [show_catalogue] and with that code inserted to a site, the catalogue will automatically pop up on that page with a fixed position.
It is made using php, css and javascript.

The repo also includes our Astra child theme with custom css changes.
