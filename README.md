> ## "Catalogue Plugin"
> This repository includes a plugin called 'catalogueplugin'.
> It's a simple pop-up plugin that lets users download ReGrow's catalogue and contact them directly.
> It uses the shortcode [show_catalogue] and with that code inserted to a site, the catalogue will automatically pop up on that page with a fixed position.
> It is made using php, css and javascript.
>
> Here is a screenshot of how the plugin looks like on the website.
